Traits
----------------
Traits are used to share interfaces and fields between classes. They are similar to Java 8â€™s interfaces. Classes and objects can extend traits, but traits cannot be instantiated and therefore have no parameters.

##### Defining a trait
Traits become especially useful as generic types and with abstract methods.
```scala
trait Iterator[A] {
  def hasNext: Boolean
  def next(): A
}
```
Extending the trait Iterator[A] requires a type A and implementations of the methods hasNext and next.
##### Using traits
Use the extends keyword to extend a trait. Then implement any abstract members of the trait using the override keyword:
```scala
trait Iterator[A] {
  def hasNext: Boolean
  def next(): A
}
class IntIterator(to: Int) extends Iterator[Int] {
  private var current = 0
  override def hasNext: Boolean = current < to
  override def next(): Int = {
    if (hasNext) {
      val t = current
      current += 1
      t
    } else 0
  }
}
val iterator = new IntIterator(10)
iterator.next()  // returns 0
iterator.next()  // returns 1
```
##### Subtyping
Where a given trait is required, a subtype of the trait can be used instead.
```scala
import scala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer
trait Pet {
  val name: String
}
class Cat(val name: String) extends Pet
class Dog(val name: String) extends Pet

val dog = new Dog("Harry")
val cat = new Cat("Sally")

val animals = ArrayBuffer.empty[Pet]
animals.append(dog)
animals.append(cat)
animals.foreach(pet => println(pet.name))  // Prints Harry Sally
```
The trait Pet has an abstract field name that gets implemented by Cat and Dog in their constructors. On the last line, we call pet.name, which must be implemented in any subtype of the trait Pet.
