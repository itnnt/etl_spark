+ It’s a modern programming language created by Martin Odersky (the father of
javac), influenced by Java, Ruby, Smalltalk, ML, Haskell, Erlang, and others.
+ It’s a pure object-oriented programming (OOP) language. Every variable is an object, and every “operator” is a method.
+ It’s also a functional programming (FP) language, so you can pass functions around
as variables. You can write your code using OOP, FP, or both.
+ Scala code runs on the JVM and lets you use the wealth of Java libraries that have
been developed over the years.
+ You can be productive on Day 1, but the language is deep, so as you go along you’ll
keep learning and finding newer, better ways to write code. Scala will change the
way you think about programming—and t hat’s a good thing.
